# Attribution — Steelbore Rust Idiom Layer

[`idioms.md`](idioms.md) is a Steelbore-authored distillation (GPL-3.0-or-later) of
rules adapted from the **Apollo GraphQL Rust Best Practices skill**. Per the
Steelbore Standard §4.2 (upstream license compliance) and §15.3 (third-party
attribution), the upstream MIT notice is preserved verbatim below.

- **Adapted work:** Apollo GraphQL — *Rust Best Practices* skill (`rust-best-practices`)
- **Source:** <https://github.com/apollographql/skills>
- **Upstream license:** MIT
- **What was adapted:** the idiom/readability rules — borrowing-vs-cloning, `Copy`
  sizing, idiomatic `Option`/`Result` flow, iterators-vs-`for`, clippy lint names and
  `expect`-over-`allow` discipline, testing conventions (one assertion per test,
  descriptive names, `insta` snapshots), static-vs-dynamic dispatch, the type-state
  pattern, comments-vs-docs, and import ordering. Apollo's error-handling and
  performance-mindset chapters were intentionally **not** adapted (covered by this
  skill's SKILL.md and by `microsoft-rust-guidelines`).

> Note: the *skill* we adapted from (the `apollographql/skills` repository) is MIT. A
> separate upstream repository — the standalone *Rust Best Practices* handbook/book —
> is Apache-2.0; we did not copy that book's text, only adapted the MIT skill, so the
> applicable notice is the MIT one below.
