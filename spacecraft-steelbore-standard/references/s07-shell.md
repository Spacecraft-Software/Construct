## §7 — Shell Environment

Spacecraft Software tooling, documentation, and CI pipelines target **four first-class shell environments**: **Nushell**, **Ion**, **Brush**, and **Bash**. All four are equally supported; none is deprecated or downgraded.

### §7.1 — Script Portability Policy

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Default: POSIX-compatible | Shell scripts in source trees, CI pipelines, `Makefile` targets, and documentation examples **must** be written to the POSIX sh subset unless a shell-native feature is required. POSIX scripts run correctly in Bash and Brush without modification. |
| Nushell / Ion native variants when needed | When a task cannot be expressed cleanly in POSIX sh (structured data pipelines, typed parameters, Nushell modules), provide a Nushell (`.nu`) and/or Ion-native variant alongside the POSIX version. Do not force POSIX-only idioms that degrade the Nushell or Ion experience. |
| No Bashisms in shared scripts | Bash-only extensions (`[[ ]]`, `(( ))`, process substitution `<(...)`, `${var^^}`, indexed arrays) are prohibited in files intended for all four shells. Bash-specific scripts are permitted only when explicitly scoped (e.g., `#!/usr/bin/env bash` shebang, clearly labeled). |
| Graceful shell detection | Tools that need runtime shell detection must inform the user or degrade gracefully rather than silently failing in non-Bash environments. |
